    <strong>INSPIRATION:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To be able to provide an environment were geography, media, and journalism
    can coexist. Together creating a union that will help spread global news
    instantaneously.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>WHAT IT DOES: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Giving online users a better medium to access the latest global news. As an
    interactive map, selecting a geographical location will provide the users
    with the most recent news outlets for that selected area. Not only does
    this service provide a fun interactive experience, but it also exposes
    users to geographical locations and news they might not have otherwise been
    exposed to.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HOW WE BUILT IT:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Using the API services provided by here.com we were able to implicate the
    interactive mapping experience. Some code languages that we incorporated:
    JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO:</strong>
</p> 
<p>
    Some challenges that we faced during the creation of this project were:
    Coming up with an original project idea. Along with trying to properly
    connect the API services so that the newest articles would be redirected to
    their corresponding locations.

    <strong>WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE GEODUDE:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Ideally it would be nice to have be able to incorporate live video to the
    webpage so that users have access to live coverage as news breaks through.
    This would offer an experience that is unbiased and up to date on all
    current global news.
